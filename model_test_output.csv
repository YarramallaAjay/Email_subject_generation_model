"Here's what Eric wrote:   I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.
Those changes  are redlined.
Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3  as well as the defined terms that go with them.
These were related to  exhaust temperature and energy.
I know this is a simple cycle plant and they  typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it  anyway.
It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined  cycle.
If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out,  then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and  their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust  guarantees.
Let me know what they decide.

I realize that there may be bigger  issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey  Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack  manager.
Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the  website, so people could shade products different colors.

The problem was, Ford's  Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases,  was even more expensive.

The result is a fine  SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content.

Three key changes: They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the  entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of  gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will  consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to  lower chances of a successful utility appeal).
The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the  pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.

"Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show  changes from Fred's last draft.
The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding;  references to  the  proposal being held  ""open"" have been deleted.
Also, I have not attempted to  include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial  benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price  higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns).

Fred - I wanted to stick to ""would"" instead of ""will""  as the operative verb  in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?
Senate May Seal SoCal's Fate ?
SoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy   California Senate & SoCal's Fate  With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.
Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.
The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:  ?

In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will ""vote for something,"" it  still doesn't appear that the ""something"" will include a measure that will  keep Edison out of bankruptcy.

"David: GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:  1.
In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the  legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.
Also, in the  second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf  of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.
[Leslie, is this a proper  exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the  Website password?]

"Chip,  I wanted to follow up regarding the issues that were raised by the cash committee relative to LRCI and our request for approx $300k to pay Dow under our lease on storage caverns #13/#14.
David Zdunkewicz, an A&K bankruptcy lawyer, was asked to consider whether it might be prudent to have the 4 Enron Partners (LRC, LRCI, LGMC, and LGMI) file voluntary petitions in bankruptcy.
The reason to do this would be primarily driven by the flexibility that it would afford the cash committee to fund some of the Enron Partner's liabilities.
It was thought that such a bankruptcy might also have the effect of invalidating the consent right that Texaco currently has on sales of the partnership interests pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.

If this happens, the party would have to call back and try again, or get a hold of your admin to leave a written message.
THE FIX:  PGE will have cards here in the morning and will replace them on Saturday.

Have there been some changes to the data sheets?

"As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.
We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.
Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.

"On Friday (October 19), DWR released a revised revenue requirement.
The result was to lower the Customer Revenue Requirement by$2.4 billion from the revenue requirement submitted on August 7th.
The stated reasons for the change are:  1.
Reduction in Gas Prices.
For example, the August estimate included a fourth quarter 2001 gas price forecast of $7.68 at the Southern California border.
In the recent submittal, this was reduced to $3.54.
2.
Change in Load because of Direct Access.
As a result of the Commission delaying the suspension date from July 1 to September 20th there was a significant bump up in DA load, thus reducing the load fo which DWR must buy.
For example, the August submittal contained an estimate of 448 GWh in the fourth quarter 2001 for direct access load.

A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and  Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).

180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.
Rockey  and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good  arguments for avoiding the liability.

Indications were that this  approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter  agreement concerning this approach.

"Ryan,  In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like to reinforce one point I made.
I feel strongly that I cannot support the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.
I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements  that you would expect from any professional.

I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple  partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.
Before we  eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in  agreement as to how this swap will terminate.
[Do we want partial  terminations based upon partial asset sales?]

Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need  to be sure that the word ""sale"" is sufficient.

As for the termination agreement, here's what I suggest:    Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the  contracts, or just the consolidation agreement?
I would suggest that we make  the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which  gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the  contracts immediately.
That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if  necessary.

"Hello Mr. Kenneth Lay,  I hope you don't mind an email from someone who is not very high in the decision-making level of Enron but I have such strong need  to share my thoughts and visions with you.

"Some thoughts that might help from time to time.
This was forwarded to me,  and I found it very compelling.
G   Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one  so  that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful  for that gift.
When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often  times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has   been opened for us.
The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a  porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it  was the best conversation you've ever had.

"Dr. Lay,  Sir, I am almost positive that all avenues have been pursued to get Enron out of the hole we are in.
However, I wanted to inquire if a reverse stock split (perhaps a 12 to 1 or 15 to 1) was a possible option.
My knoweledge in terms of Enron's debt and who we are indebted to is limited to what I have heard through the media, but as I see it, many creditors are at a great risk to lose billions of dollars.
Would banks such as JP Morgan or Citigroup or others potentially affected such as Janus Funds or Lehman Brothers be willing to invest in equity rather than pump in more debt?
From my understanding, we need an immediate $4 billion, and I think this may be a potential solution to get instant cash, and then we can turn our interests to building customer and investor confidence.

I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run  will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to  move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect  their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing  sector).
The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily  be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will  realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.
It is not a bad model just a different one.
Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall  Street.

"Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:  1.
In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated  Subsidiary can be deleted.
2.
In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added  at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words ""Swap Agreement"" ""(as it  relates to the Assigned Interest)""?
In other words, if these events as to  Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination  event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap  Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?
3.
I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross  default language that Enron is now using.

In Section 3.8, the word comments should be ""consents"".

Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business.
The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest.

Over the last few weeks, the bond market has rallied (except for today), despite early indications that May was a relatively solid month for the consumer.
If consumer spending remains strong, the US economy is likely to avoid a recession.
With inflation under control, and the economy hopefully emerging from the slowdown over the next few quarters, it seems that financial assets, and in particular stocks, should perform well going forward.
While there are some sub-sectors of the economy that are in a recession (such as manufacturing and the tech.
sector), they too should start to respond to an improvement in the overall economy.

"Whales,  Just a short note to congratulate you on your success at Enron.
I had an email written shortly after your promotion but then the 9/11 shi* happened and I lost track of it.
Well now that you guys are back in the news quite a bit I figured that I should at least send you a note.
Even considering the issues currently facing Enron, I am sure you will emerge strong and better than before- you always had a knack for that at school and I am sure it will continue now.
We started down the track of doing business with you guys (in the areas of financial products and insurance) but I don't know how the upcoming merger will effect that.

Dale Neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding FX transactions on  EOL.
Have you concluded that we need RMT as the EOL party for internal  hedging FX products for London and Japan.
Am I correct in the following?
RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron  affiliates (i.e., ECTRIC, through EEFT, and Enron Japan) under new/existing  services agreements.
ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties.
Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the  situation should arise?)

I have a call in to  Drew Fossum to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you  in that loop in case you get any inquiries.

She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.
Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.
At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.
With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.

Initial distribution may be slow but is expected to pick up as mail that had been stored in a secured campus facility is processed.

"I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.
With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.
To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.
Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.
Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.
After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.
Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.

October 1, 2001 8:00 a.m.   Crucial to winning the global war against terrorism is a bold plan to wage war on the domestic recession.
But Washington has no such plan.
Respected policymakers look timid, cautious, and out of touch with the reality of a declining economy.

Plaintiffs are now pressing for a deposition on December 5 of a Rule 30(b)(6) corporate representative of TW in this matter in Houston at Susman, Godfrey's office.
You have already sent to me a list of contracts that might be relevant.
Bill Rapp got a telefax just recently on this from a Wes Hahn, who is apparently acting as a consultant/expert in this case for defendants.
Hahn has suggested that he appear as TW's corporate rep in this matter.
Hahn advises that he was an officer of TW and Enron ""at the time that this contract was in force and when it was terminated.""

However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors to be taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be tried with dead horses, including the following:       1.

"September 5, 2001 Business World Crisis?
What Crisis?
By HOLMAN W. JENKINS, JR.
The big news this summer is that Californians haven't been reduced to stone-age lifestyles, running naked in the streets and eating each other.
The state barely had enough electricity to get through this past winter, when demand was not yet pumped up with air-conditioning.
Yet here they are surviving the summer with nary a blackout.

Gray Davis must be some kind of a wizard, pulling 15,000 megawatts from his pointy hat.
He gave every indication of being a hapless cluck, but obviously we underestimated him.

An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.
There have been  three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.
The topic is  technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.

However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously  would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the  book.
She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary  information, however.

"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

"Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.
04/06/2001 Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday  it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its  broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously  described as an internal redeployment of staff.
Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is  cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has  completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network  and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal  computers.

This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.
Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.
BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

"Jeff,  A few comments on the model:  1.
We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like  to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of  our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the  details and in the inputs and calibration.
The same model may produce drastically different results  depending on the quality of inputs.

"David,  Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.
1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the  positions can be pulled into the benchmark.
2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is  overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.
3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.
If one of  your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books  your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.
This  process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.

Collaberative meeting are supposed to be taking place over the next month, but Enron's regulatory view is that a setlement will not be able to be reached.
The question is if First Energy is still interested in persuing the merger if a rate increase does not occur.
If the merger does not occur, I think this increases our chances of a deal to mitigate GPU's risk, if we can work out the credit issues.

"As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.
It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.
Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.
However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible.

"Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate  pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it  must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some  other basis.
It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that  capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.
However, I did not  find any case that stands for that exact proposition.
As you may be aware,  the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up  with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory  basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to  its shippers.

Steve, based on our meeting in Houston, I met with our engineering and operations folks to discuss the possibility of putting together a new firm (or limited firm) Park N Ride storage service on the pipeline project.
Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.
The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?
For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.

"Ben,  Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.
One issue is when this transaction can close.
Since the equipment is owned  by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the  transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the  WestLB facility.
If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle  back with Lisa.
A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both  ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for  payment for changes, storage, etc.

"Here is where I understand things stand based on our discussions this morning:  1.
Vitol SA - Tom Moran sent an e-mail to Mark Leskowitz asking if Vitol has paid Enron.
I have not heard from Mark or Tom.
The LC expires on 12/28.
2.
El Paso - I just sent an e-mail summarizing the netting situation.
If the netting was proper then our only grounds for drawing is failure to renew the LC.
We sent them a letter yesterday about this.
Credit was going to contact them.
We can draw as early as next Wednesday.
3.
Great Bay - same as El Paso absent the netting issue.
4.
LG&E Energy Marketing - they owe us  a payment next Wednesday.
We will wait to see if they have paid and if they haven't we can declare them in default and draw.
If they have, we can draw based on a failure to renew the LC.

No clear indication resulted from those seven responses (four in favor of proceeding with the Protocol; three in favor of working on a new Master Agreement with no Protocol).
Before ISDA proceeds in either direction, it would be helpful to have wider market input.
I should point out that ISDA intends to work on a new 2002 or 2003 Master Agreement; timing is the only issue - whether the process begins imminently or nine months from now.
The benefits of proceeding with the Protocol is that it takes advantage of the considerable time and effort that has been invested in the initiative to date.

"Greg,  I've been working with an IT guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for  some of us that can receive live prices from EOL.
I've used this to build a  real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas  locations, including variable cost analysis, NPV, etc.
I think that this  would be an extremely useful application to include on the EOL site, whether  it is in Excel format or some homemade format.
For example, Hunter and I  were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk  components of their PBR.

"John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock  receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement  TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.
My understanding is that  physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will  simply be a paper transfer.
Since a contract is required in our system as a  formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will ""charge"" itself for the  transfer is $0.

"Rod: Here are their credit issues:  1.
In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically  says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting  determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its  obligations under the Master is ""endangered"", then no cross default is  triggered.
2.
In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the  ""materially weaker"" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated  below BBB- by S&P.
Do you feel strongly about this?

"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final  P&L.
You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the  adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.
At the close of business for the 991  P&L, we saw a gain of approx.
$250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.
We  thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to  offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.
Therefore,  the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.
